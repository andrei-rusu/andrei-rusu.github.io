Our love was young and pure, <br />
And for the cancer of the world <br />
It was the only real cure... <br />

But I was blinded all along <br />
By my ambition and my thought, <br />
She had suffered for too long <br />
'Cause only sorrow I had brought. <br />

Every time she reappeared <br />
Out of true love and compassion, <br />
Her wounds were again seared <br />
By a psycho with no ration. <br />

I killed her spirit times again <br />
As my mind was twisted, <br />
And she said "no more" in pain, <br />
Killing me instead. <br />

Even at our funeral, <br />
To her, my kiss still harms <br />
And her cries? Immortal, <br />
In my dead unworthy arms... <br />

With the last gasp I scream! <br />
For my sick mind is the cause <br />
Of all her pain, and our loss...
