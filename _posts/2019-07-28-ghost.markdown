The past intoxicates my sanity, <br />
It bathes in dirty blood my senses. <br />
Future seems to have no utility, <br />
Because the only poison it despenses <br />
Is my single chance of normality. <br />

Though I leave myself in darkness, <br />
Hoping for a dim of light <br />
To clear up my world of mess <br />
And cast away the night...<br />
Nothing comes in nothingness. <br />

My soul is trapped in pain... <br />
Trying to escape the agony, <br />
It cuts off my surviving vein, <br />
Leaving me without any mercy <br />
To struggle for my life in vain. <br />

Everyday crying for the things I lost, <br />
My tears become death fairies. <br />
But I'll be in the end my own ghost, <br />
Haunting forever the memories <br />
My tombstone loves and hates the most.
