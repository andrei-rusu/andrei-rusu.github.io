Because...
...I was dull <br />
just for her fun, <br /> 
She was all,  <br />
and I was none. <br />

Because...
...I was always there <br />
with her, <br />
She was elsewhere, <br />
getting over. <br />

Because...
...Even if it cuts me open <br />
and burns just like an oven, <br />
I will love, beyond forever, <br />
the false image I had of her. <br />

Because...
...Only if she would care, <br />
she could stop right now to tear <br />
my world into dead pieces <br />
fed to her life of misses. <br />
 
Because...
...The odd vixen and the psychopath <br />
Share in the end the same path: <br />
Forced by the wind to flee, <br />
United again by the sea.
